1.
e.Explain why ‘body’ has that particular type with reference to the structure of HTTP responses.

In pyhthon body=response.read() .this gives url data in hex code but this variabe type is BYTE.
Therefore body create a string using the decode() method of bytes. 
This method takes an encoding argument, such as UTF-8, and optionally an errors argument.

h.What difference do you see  if you call the method .decode(“utf-8”) on the body data received in
(g) before printing it?
 
only get b''
The "b" stands for bytes and serves as a declaration for the type of the object you're handling
json works with Unicode text in Python 3 (JSON format itself is defined only in terms of Unicode text) and 
therefore you need to decode bytes received in HTTP
response. r.headers.get_content_charset('utf-8') gets your the character encoding:
 
2.
k.What is URL encoding/decoding? Why is it necessary?


URL encoding, also known as Percent-encoding, is a mechanism for encoding information in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) under certain circumstances.
URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
URL decoding is decode the encoded url.
The URL representation of characters may differ from the characters in the code. In other words, there is a specific grammar that
defines how URLs are assembled. Special characters that are used in forming a URL need to be encoded so that they do not cause unexpected results.
These characters (&, ?, for example) are given special meaning to function in a certain way. Therefore, they cannot be used in a different context. 
Decode is useful for decoding the URL to get the string representation of the URL before it was encoded for manipulation/other functions in the application.
