Can a task ever make an illegal transition due to a race condition during update? Explain why (not.)

yes a task ever make an illegal transition due to a race condition during update
A race condition occurs when two or more clients can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.
After one client change the state of a task and at the same time other client calling that task thinking the state was not changed.But the second client get a illegal
transition because task was changed according to first clients requirements.Therefore problem will occure when more clients going to change the same tasks.
